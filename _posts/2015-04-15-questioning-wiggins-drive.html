At 2:16 of the video Wiggins throws down a monster dunk on an opposing player.

Then he gets in his face.

Its hard to tell if there is any back story as to why Wiggins was so aggressive after that play and dunk. The player Wiggins dunked on was actually help D that came across after Wiggins blew by 2 other defenders.

But Wiggins was still in his face big time. It wasn't enough that he just absolutely posterized his opponent.

Wiggins showed his underlying drive. The competitive fire he has. In articles that feature his father he often speaks about his son's drive and competitive spirit. Wiggins has two older brothers, a Dad that played in the NBA and a Mother who went to the Olympics. That environment is a pressure cooker for a competitive edge.

In reality Wiggins motor arguably runs higher than anyone else in the league. The amazing thing about Wiggins is he can control it. He turns it on when he wants (see any game in which he goes against the NBA elite and particularly the NBA team that traded him). This is actually the ideal mindset for sports.

Does Wiggins have the Motor/Aggression/Passion it takes to be the greatest?

Look at the clip again and try and tell yourself its not there.

He's been keeping it more dormant as he first figures the NBA out but if you watch the past month hes let a little bit more out on each consecutive posterizing dunk he's had. Just because people don't see it all the time doesn't mean its not there. It will be there when he wants it to and the bigger the stage the stronger it will be.
