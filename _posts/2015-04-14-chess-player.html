There has been a sharp trajectory upwards for Wiggins this season. But has he really changed as a player?

Yes and no. He has had the same gifts, abilities and game IQ but he has also just been figuring things out and acclimating himself to his new league and new team.

It's safe to say he is now comfortable. Over the past month he is now announcing to the world that he is ready. He was taking this year to see what the NBA is all about. The skill sets, the player sizes, the players speed. He now knows what he's going up against.

He's showing us with dunks like this:

On 7'1" Rudy Gobert who is known for his shot-blocking ability. He could have been making these types of plays all season but he's just now turning it on.

Wiggins had a breakthrough season this year. But its only a stepping stone for what he'll do next year. He has just shown glimpses in the past month or so of whats to come.
