Above is an back and forth with David Thorpe on Wiggins and how the 3 pointer factors into his game.

And here's a more in depth look:

As far as this site is concerned Wiggins already has the 3-ball as part of his repertoire. But its all about when you use it. Wiggins showed early on this season he could knock down the long ball with consistency. More recently and specifically since all star break he's only hit 4-5 of them. He also hasn't taken many 3 point attempts.

We've also seen Wiggins make some of his most jaw dropping dunks. He has been in attack mode at the end of the season whereas during the first half he was sitting back and learning. His long range shooting has only been affected by it being rusty from not using it often. When he and his coaching staff decide its time to become more a part of his offense it will be there.
