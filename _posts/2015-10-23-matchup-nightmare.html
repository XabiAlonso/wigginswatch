<br>
<p> Wiggins has speed and athleticism of a track star (Genes from a former NBA player father and Olympic track medalist mother). It's questionable whether anyone in the league could match his foot-speed. A move to shooting-guard could pose big problems for his oponents. He's 6'8" and showed a phenomenal and mature post game last year. All this spells trouble for the competition as Wiggins will likely be a match-up nightmare for most teams. </p>
