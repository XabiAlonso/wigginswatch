All GOAT players have their unique trademark.

Gretzky had the jersey tuck. Jordan had the tongue and his banned red shoes. This is something that makes these players uniquely noticeable on the court. Kids emulate it. Having a trademark style or look is something GOATs just have.

What's Wiggins? Hard to tell right now but he was doing an angular side fade with his hair on the sides of his head.

The one that seems likely to become his trademark is the cape. He often has the back of his jersey untucked. When he goes up for his mindblowing dunks he appears to be flying and the little untucked part at the back of his jersey is his cape. Still early to tell but you shouldn't be surprised if you see kids out on public basketball courts starting to copy what could become a signature look for Wiggins.
